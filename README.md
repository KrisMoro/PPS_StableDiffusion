- **PPS-A1111.ipynb**: this notebook facilitates a quick and easy means to access the Automatic1111 Stable Diffusion Web UI. Simply click run all at the top of the screen to get a link to the web app. Additionally, you may change the default model/path, and set a username and password for the session.
- **PPS-Dreambooth-v1.ipynb && PPS-Dreambooth-v2.ipynb**: these notebooks makes it easy to quickly train a Dreambooth checkpoint on any images. This method makes it simple to directly upload and caption your own images via the upload modal. Alternatively, users may paste the path to an uploaded directory of images on the instance.
  **NOTE** The Dreambooth notebook's upload button is currently blocked in the Gradient Notebook GUI. To use the uploader, select the Jupyter Lab button using the left-hand sidebar to open your instance in Jupyter Labs, and re-run the notebook code.)
